### Extended

I'm ~very slowed response~ ~autistic~ desktop developer, little system developer enthusiast...,
interested in math, Windows NT internals, desktop architectures,
and other big legacy (i.e. `OS/2` executable 16/32-bit model).

Sometimes I'm very emotional potato, and I try to hide it in huge
research or deep inside the mind.
Sometimes I'm seeing nightmares, wake up and taking notes
what needs to be changed or implemented. 

Visual Basic 6 was my first programming language 
when I started spending all my time after school at dadâ€™s office. 
The games at home on the computer was not, and I was almost always 
inside MS Office or 
just looking for something unfamiliar on the system disk.

Beginning from last year I've decided saving my notes
here, using LaTeX, but I'm taking it on Russian language.
